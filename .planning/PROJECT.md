# EMEL

## What This Is

EMEL is a deterministic C++ inference engine built around Boost.SML orchestration, with behavior
modeled as explicit actors instead of ad hoc control flow. Shipped v1.0 proves one narrow
brownfield outcome: an end-to-end Llama-68M generation parity path inside `tools/paritychecker`
that follows `docs/rules/sml.rules.md`.

## Core Value

Prove real end-to-end behavior with explicit SML orchestration and parity-oriented verification
before widening API surface or model scope.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Boost.SML actor machines remain the orchestration source of truth under `src/emel/**/sm.hpp`
  — existing
- ✓ The repo already includes parity and benchmark tooling plus local GGUF fixtures under
  `tools/paritychecker/`, `tools/bench/`, and `tests/models/` — existing
- ✓ One canonical `tests/models/Llama-68M-Chat-v1-Q2_K.gguf` generation slice is wired end to end
  through paritychecker — v1.0
- ✓ The slice uses real EMEL GGUF/model loading, generator initialization, bounded generation, and
  reference comparison — v1.0
- ✓ Generation mode now has subprocess success and failure coverage through the standard parity gate
  chain — v1.0
- ✓ The milestone audit passed with 14/14 requirements satisfied for the Llama-68M slice — v1.0

### Active

- [ ] Expand generation parity across more GGUF fixtures under `tests/models/`
- [ ] Reduce the paritychecker pre-initialize backfill from `llama.cpp` so more runtime ownership
  stays inside EMEL
- [ ] Decide whether the proven generation slice should graduate into a public C API or standalone
  example outside `tools/paritychecker/`

### Out of Scope

- Broad repository cleanup unrelated to a milestone goal
- Snapshot churn or architecture-doc churn that is not explicitly approved for update
- Non-paritychecker product surfaces until a milestone explicitly broadens the acceptance boundary

## Current State

Shipped version: `v1.0`

- 7 phases and 15 plans delivered the first canonical Llama-68M parity slice.
- The audited E2E flow is `paritychecker --generation --model tests/models/Llama-68M-Chat-v1-Q2_K.gguf --text hello --max-tokens 1`.
- Current non-blocking debt is narrow: the paritychecker handoff still backfills some runtime state
  from `llama.cpp`, and `scripts/quality_gates.sh` still tolerates benchmark snapshot drift.

## Next Milestone Goals

- Expand coverage beyond one fixture without weakening deterministic gate behavior.
- Continue moving generation ownership inward toward EMEL rather than paritychecker-local bridging.
- Reassess whether a public generation surface belongs in the next milestone or should stay
  paritychecker-only longer.

## Context

This is a brownfield repository with an existing codebase map under `.planning/codebase/`. v1.0
showed that the existing subsystem families under `src/emel/` are sufficient to prove one real
generation path without widening the public API surface. The repo remains governed by `AGENTS.md`
and `docs/rules/sml.rules.md`, so future work still needs to preserve same-RTC actor semantics,
explicit error publication, bounded actions, and deliberate machine-structure changes.

## Constraints

- **Architecture**: Follow `docs/rules/sml.rules.md` and the local machine conventions in
  `AGENTS.md` — the generation slice must preserve the RTC actor model and no-queue invariant
- **Acceptance boundary**: Milestones should expand intentionally; v1.0 proved paritychecker-first
  generation, not a general public API surface
- **Model scope**: v1.0 locked one canonical Llama-68M fixture first; broader model matrices should
  only expand under an explicit next-milestone goal
- **Performance philosophy**: Favor explicit orchestration correctness first, then optimize once
  parity-oriented behavior is locked
- **Repository state**: This is an active brownfield codebase, so milestone work should still
  minimize unrelated churn

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Target the Llama-68M GGUF model first | It is a small local test model already present in `tests/models/` and is suitable for proving a narrow vertical slice | ✓ Good |
| Define done in paritychecker, not the public C API | The immediate goal is parity-oriented end-to-end generation proof, not API surface expansion | ✓ Good |
| Optimize for a narrow vertical slice | This reduces planning noise and avoids turning the first proof into a general cleanup campaign | ✓ Good |
| Enforce SML rules as a first-class planning constraint | The repo architecture and user requirements both depend on `docs/rules/sml.rules.md` semantics | ✓ Good |
| Insert Phase 1.1 to implement the real GGUF loader | The stubbed loader became the hard blocker for the milestone | ✓ Good |
| Close `HARN-02` with canonical-path fixture enforcement | The audit exposed that basename-only validation overstated the shipped contract | ✓ Good |
| Keep the normal paritychecker and quality-gate scripts as the verification surface | Reusing existing gates kept the slice honest and minimized repo churn | ✓ Good |
| Leave benchmark snapshot drift policy unchanged during v1.0 | The milestone prioritized generation correctness over repo-wide gate-policy changes | ⚠ Revisit |
