- [x] [v1.11: TE-75M GGUF Trimodal Embedding Runtime](.planning/milestones/v1.11-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-15 with maintained TE trimodal embedding runtime support, refreshed closeout
    evidence, and a passing milestone audit.
- [x] [v1.12: Pluggable Reference Parity Bench Architecture](.planning/milestones/v1.12-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-18, reopened narrowly for archived closeout-proof repair on 2026-04-19, and
    returned to a passing rerun audit on 2026-04-20.
- [x] [v1.13: Pluggable Generative Parity Bench](.planning/milestones/v1.13-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-21 with a maintained generative compare contract, workload manifests,
    `llama_cpp_generation` reference lane, truthful comparable/non-comparable publication, and a
    no-blocker audit.
- [x] [v1.14: Benchmark Variant Organization](.planning/milestones/v1.14-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-21 with deterministic data-owned benchmark variant discovery for generation
    and embedding variants.
- [x] [v1.15: ARM Sortformer Diarization GGUF Slice](.planning/milestones/v1.15-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-25 with one maintained native Sortformer diarization GGUF slice, PyTorch/NeMo
    parity, ONNX CPU single-thread benchmark reference, EMEL-over-ONNX performance closure, and a
    passing source-backed milestone audit.
- [x] [v1.16: ARM Whisper GGUF Parity And Performance](.planning/milestones/v1.16-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-28 with one maintained Whisper tiny GGUF ASR slice, speech-owned runtime
    actors, recognizer-backed exact transcript parity, matched single-thread ARM benchmark proof,
    and source-backed closeout evidence.
- [x] [v1.17: Text Generator Domain Alignment](.planning/milestones/v1.17-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-04-30 after Phase 147 removed the final source-backed `TEXTGEN-04` /
    `TEXTGEN-07` blocker: maintained graph validation, bind, and extract callbacks no longer
    route graph outcomes through action-called `detail.hpp` helper failures or `err_out`.

- [x] [v1.18: Parity Tool Boundary Refactor](.planning/milestones/v1.18-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-05-01 after reopened source-backed gap closure through Phases 153-156; final
    audit passed with 12/12 active requirements satisfied.

- [x] [v1.19: Benchmark Tool Pluggable Runner Refactor](.planning/milestones/v1.19-ROADMAP.md)
  - Shipped 2026-05-01 after reopened source-backed gap closure through Phases 164-166; final
    audit passed with 13/13 active requirements satisfied.
