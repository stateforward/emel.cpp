these rules extend the repository-level contract.

## reference implementation exceptions
linking against llama.cpp and ggml is allowed within `tools/paritychecker`.
using `llama_` and `ggml_` prefixes in identifiers, symbols, files, and APIs is
allowed within `tools/paritychecker`.

all other repository rules still apply.
